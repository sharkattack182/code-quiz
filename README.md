# code-quiz
This was my fourth homework assignment and the difficulty was much higher than the previous assignments. I wrote and rewrote this code probably four times. Iaccidently added all of my questions at one point in the wrong format from another version. 

I've lost alot of hair coding this but I finally got it done. I wish I had more time to go through and add more style to it. 

The objective of the exercise was to create a timed quiz with multiple choice questions. One of the requirements is that if the question is answered wrong time is deducted from the player. After all questions are answered the remaining time is the players score. After that the last requirement is that the player needs to be able to record the highscore on their local storage. 

AS I mentioned this project was very difficult. I played alot of whack a mole building it and then when my final project was complete I rebuilt it piece by piece in the repository. Cant wait to get started on project number 5.
